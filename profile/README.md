## Welcome to Freedom Scoops Project

Freedom Scoops is an inspired free and open source Chex Quest style IWAD that is the equivalent of Freedoom. 
Aims to create a free content package for the doom engine. That can be played openly anywhere, even on GNU distributions. 
It can be played on any source ports of DOOM, has Chex support, and even aims to be vanilla compatible with the DOS version.Â 

Would you like to help or support the project? Hop on into the LK community discord, where Freedom Scoops is being developed.

Also has a small relation to the Luke Ken project universe.
